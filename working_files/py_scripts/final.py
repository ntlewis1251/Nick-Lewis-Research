"""
Final py script for pycogs, WIP.

Arguments order:  N (째), E (째), S (째), W (째), Resolution (m), Watershed Dataset Scale, Project Title, API Key
"""

"""
**Script Goals**
- Enter coordinate bounding box, RES, proj title (applied to all exp files with appropriate suffix)
- Export files include:
	- Folders for each watershed w name
        - Relief map
	    - Slope map (similar but not the same!)
	    - Knickpoints mapped (maybe adjust delta ksn?  To isolate bedrock reaches.)
		- For each stream, profile w sed cover represented by colorramp
			- How to determine?  Albedo dataset is one possibility.  I.e reflectivity is modulated by stream cover.  Problem is trees.
		- Profile w trimodal morphology represented (maybe, refer to chuck suggestion)
	- CSVs of knickpoints
		- To be included:
        - Wshed
		- elevation
		- Coords
		- Shapefile geology
		- Nearest roadcut geology that is also within some threshold of elevation from knickpoint.  Do buffer around knickpoint select closest to elevation.
		- Stream cover type (to allow narrowing to bedrock)
		- If BR, fracture data, if AP, bedding
		- If not in AP or BR, Send back a message being like sorry dawg.
		- Depth to mantle @ knickpoint.  Z score to average depth in region.
		- Slope

# Note: I know i saw a roadcut mapping project done by university of Tennessee.  I know it exists.  AGH! 
# Note: Ask about geology APIs to reduce file downloads needed.
